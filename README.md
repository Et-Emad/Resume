# Resume

This repository contains my professional resume written in LaTeX. Feel free to use it as a template or refer to it for your own resume.

I wrote this LaTeX code on the Overleaf website, which is an easy-to-use, online LaTeX editor. You can also use Overleaf to edit and compile this code.

## How to Compile

To compile the LaTeX file, you need a LaTeX distribution like TeX Live or MiKTeX. You can compile the file using the following command:

```bash
pdflatex resume.tex
